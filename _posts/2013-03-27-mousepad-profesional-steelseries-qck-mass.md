I came across the [SteelSeries QcK mass](https://www.emag.ro/mousepad-profesional-steelseries-qck-mpstqck/pd/EFSVDBBBM/?psid=9386110&utm_source=profitshare&utm_medium=direct_link), a professional cloth mousepad compatible with all types of mice. Its dimensions are 320mm x 285mm x 6mm. What I like most about it is that it doesn't slide around on the desk—the rubberized base does its job perfectly.<!--more-->
