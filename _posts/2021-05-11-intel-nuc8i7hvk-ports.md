Intel NUC8i7HVK (Hades Canyon) is a connectivity beast. For a machine this small, the sheer number of I/O options is impressive, making it a perfect "lab" PC or a compact workstation.

Here is a detailed breakdown of all the ports available on this unit:

### Front Panel
The front is designed for quick access, especially for VR headsets and removable media:
* **Power Button** with customizable RGB LED.
* **SDXC Card Reader:** Supports UHS-I for fast photo and video transfers.
* **USB 3.0 Type-A (Orange):** Charging port that provides power even when the NUC is off.
* **USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A (Blue):** High-speed 10Gbps data transfer.
* **HDMI 2.0a:** Specifically placed here for easy VR headset (like Oculus or Vive) connectivity.
* **USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C:** 10Gbps port for modern peripherals.
* **3.5mm Audio Jack:** Combined headphone/microphone port.
* **Infrared Sensor:** For remote control support.

### Rear Panel
The back is where the heavy lifting happens, supporting up to six 4K displays:
* **TOSLINK/Optical Audio:** Combined with a 3.5mm jack for high-end audio setups.
* **DC Power Input:** For the 230W power brick.
* **2x Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C):** 40Gbps ports that support daisy-chaining, external GPUs, or extra displays.
* **2x Mini DisplayPort 1.2:** Dedicated video outputs.
* **2x Intel Gigabit LAN:** Dual RJ45 ports, ideal for building a home lab, router, or link aggregation.
* **4x USB 3.0 Type-A:** For your standard peripherals (Keyboard, Mouse, etc.).
* **HDMI 2.0a:** Main display output for monitors or TVs.

### Internal Headers
If you open the case, you also have access to:
* **2x M.2 Slots:** Supporting both SATA and NVMe SSDs (RAID-0/1 capable).
* **Internal USB Headers:** 2x USB 3.0 and 2x USB 2.0 headers for internal expansions or custom lids.

This specific port layout is exactly why I kept the NUC in my setup even after getting the MacBook Pro M2 Max—it acts as the perfect localized server and peripheral hub.
